Data Source: This dataset is a customized output format from the GEANT4 simulation.

Description:
1st Column: Material ID
- 11, 12, 13, and 14 represent the scintillation panels or muon tracker 1, 2, 3, and 4 repsectively from top to bottom.
- 0 represents "World" volume which is a surrounding volume which is comprised with air. 
- 1, 2, 3, and 4 represents target materials, aluminum, steel, lead, and uranium samples, respectively.
- Details of dimension of materials are described in the manuscript.

2nd Column: Particle ID
- 1 presents a muon.
- 0 presents other particles, mostly photons.

3rd, 4th, and 5th columns
- They represent x, y, and z coordinates of a particle position in cm.
- The type of particle can be found in 2nd column.

6th Column: Muon Energy
- It represents the muon energy in MeV.
- No energy is recorded for other particles.
- The initial muon energy follows the probability from a cosmic ray muon energy distribution.

A new muon event is initiated when 5th column is returnted to 245 cm in which a particle gun initiates.
